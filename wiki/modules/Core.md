> The Core module is primarily intended for developers working on GroovyEngine itself. It contains the underlying implementations for many of the engine's core systems.

While the code is well-documented, it is aimed at those with a deep understanding of the engine's architecture. For most users, the other modules will provide all the necessary functionality.
